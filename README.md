# WU-DD-EVENT

A collaborative project between students of [Digital Design](https://www.yrgo.se/program/digital-designer/) and [Web Development](https://www.yrgo.se/program/webbutvecklare/) at Yrgo.

The assignment was to create a website for a networking event for companies and students.

The companies should be able to input information about their company in a form and students should be able to look for companies by for example filtering.
